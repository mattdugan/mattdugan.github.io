Summary: Use Red Hat Software Collections for modern application development.


Welcome to our first episode of Deep with Dugan.  This ongoing series will
provide short in depth looks at the technologies we leverage at Shadow Soft and
through our partners.  If something strikes us in the industry, you might see
it here as well.  This first episode explores using Red Hat Software
Collections for modern application development.
 
The first obstacle many people encounter when using Red Hat Enterprise Linux as
their enterprise development platform is the apparent lack of the modern
languages and tools they are accustomed to using.  For example, Python 3, PHP
5, or Ruby on Rails or even the 5.2 release of PostgreSQL.
 
Watch the video below to learn more, and see Red Hat Software Collections set
up and used, live:
