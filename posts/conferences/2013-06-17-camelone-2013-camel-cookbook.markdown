summary: Doh! I missed the Camel Cookbook session by a hair.

Unfortunately by the time my flight landed and I took the bus and
two subways to the Hynes Convention Center in Boston, MA, got
registered, issued a badge and had my bearings -- the Camel
Cookbook session was full and overflowing. Scott Cranton must
be in top form.

Oh well, great time for a coffee and a chance to familiarize
myself with the conference session layout before camping out 
in front of the upcoming JUDCon session on JBoss Grid and 
WebSockets.
