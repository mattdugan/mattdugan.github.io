Leaving AT&T
============

About one month ago today, I realized that the time has come to move on.
While I am leaving some people I have grown to admire, respect, and 
consider as my friends, new opportunities present themselves each day
and I must choose the path which aligns best with my career drivers:

* Pursuit of new challenges
* Collaboration and Community
* Open Source Innovation
* Results

Today, I have returned from the [2013 RedHat Summit](http://www.redhat.com/summit) 
and begin my first day in my office at my new job, as a Middleware 
Solutions Architect for [Shadow-Soft](http://www.shadow-soft.com).

(More posts to come about the RedHat Summit)

In my new role, I'm finally on the revenue side of a business rather
than an (IT) cost center.  I'll be doing some pre-sales, sales
engineering, and lots of architecture, presentations, training, and
concept development.

Things are looking bright for 2013 and the future.
