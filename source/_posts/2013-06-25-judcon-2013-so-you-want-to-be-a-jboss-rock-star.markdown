Eric Schabell gave an emphatic _rah rah_ presentation to encourage everyone
in attendance (not as many as you might think) to become actively involved
in speaking roles about technology, developer process, or really anything
they are passionate about.  This sounds kind of ho-hum and obvious, but it
is true advice for taking a career to the next step by becoming known for
_who_ you are as well as well as _what_ you do.  This notion was an 
important one in my decision to make a career change and come work for
[Shadow Soft](http://www.shadow-soft.com).

Knowledge, Passion and Tools
----------------------------

The three tenants to your growth process are knowledge about what you
do (or what you want to be known for doing), the passion to do it and do 
it well, and the tools you need in order to be successful in communicating
it to the world (or your desired audience, but why aim low?)

To exercise your personal growth, Eric recommends a simple three step plan:

1. Choose your story you want to tell, or the project you want to be known
   through.
2. Practice uniformity (more on this later)
3. Integrate it with _the Cloud_, or, differently phrased, make your
   work discoverable and consumable by others via an established (and 
   popular) mechanism.

If you are a developer or want to show things in the technology space, 
practice making the _evidence_ of your work public, mobile ready and
available through a common asset that your audience will have at their
disposal.  Generally, this can be summarized as "Put it on the web."

Choosing your story or project is the first step because, as those of us
who have or work with children often offer as advice, it isn't enough to 
want to be "rich" or "famous" or "popular".  You have to answer the question 
of _what_ it is that made you rich or famous or popular.  Remember, people
can be well known for their spectacular failures just as well as they
can be known for spectacular success.  However, no one is known for 
simply not trying.

Uniformity, particularly in the software space, can be applied to mean
the mode in which your software or concepts are downloaded, consumed and
how they interact with the participant.  Eric offers up his own template
for doing so on GitHub, via the [JBoss Rock Star Template](https://www.github.com/aschabell/jboss-rock-star-template).

It is important that you create a template for your own projects as well,
but stick to providing short and simple instructions for consuming it.  If
space is not prohibitive, include _everything_ someone needs to get going
all in the same place.  Consider:

* How will the participant retrieve my project?
* How will they install it?
* How will they run it?
* How long do they want to spend on it?
* Where can they look for help?
* What is the perception I want them to have?

Answering these questions might lead you to select a uniform installation
script, a public hosting provider like GitHub for your open source projects,
a cloud hosting provider like [OpenShift](http://www.openshift.com), a
initialization script and corresponding local/remote deployment script, and
a README file in the root of your project.

Closing Thoughts
----------------

If this all seems so simple, we have only to ask "Am I doing it yet?"  If not,
why not, and is that a good reason.  I want to move forward.  Not everyone 
does (which can be a good thing).
