  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ah, the end of day Keynote, time to sit back and relax and
enjoy some light presentation that doesn&rsquo;t require any
brain power at all.</p>

<p>&hellip; But it wasn&rsquo;t meant to be.  Mark Proctor was the presenter
and when they guy talking to you looks like he can juggle
a couple of Voltswagens, you had better listen.</p>

<h2>jBPM, Drools, BRMS, what?</h2>

<p>Coming from a background heavy in BPM, the confusion is
natural and isn&rsquo;t exclusive to the decision maker, the
implementer, or even the business user.  Each technology
has certain merits and this session helped to clarify
<a href="https://www.jboss.org/drools/">Drools</a>. Drools is not so
much a &ldquo;Business Rule&rdquo; engine as it is a <em>Hybrid Reasoning
Engine</em> supporting filters, logic, and chains.  Drools
includes features for CEP (Complex Event Processing),
Decision Tables for processing high numbers of rules and
<em>Time Windowing</em> &ndash; a powerful feature allowing you to
write logic for events that occur &ldquo;over the last 5 minutes&rdquo;
or other relative time periods.</p>

<p>Next, we looked at BRMS, which packages Drools and jBPM
together along with a rule repository to achieve a very
useful integration pattern.  Often, business users struggle
with expressing a complete process (as opposed to merely
a high-level process) in BPMN.  Eventually, the implementation
starts to look like code, graphical or not.  Rules, on
the other hand, <em>are</em> code but do not easily work upward
to describe an overall business process.  Putting the
two together is a peanut-butter-on-chocolate approach
designed to achieve common code patterns using Rule
logic while expressing the transitions between rule chains
and processes using BPMN.  This concept works surprisingly
well and I have to commend the RedHat BRMS team for
thinking outside of the single-purpose tool package we see
from other vendors.</p>

<p>The upcoming release of BRMS embedding Drools 6 gains
the ability of JBoss Truth Management to enable handling
of contraditions in the rule chain &ndash; for example a
discount rule of 10% and a temporary discount of 20% are
in conflict unless the contradiction can be managed to say
that the 20% rate is valid over a particular time window
and otherwise default to the 10% rule.  MultiCore processing
additions in Drools 6 should provide a significant speedup
in the next release of BRMS as well.</p>

<p>The Drools 6 UI gets a much needed refresh to fix some
old nuances and adds resizable panels for getting work
done within the browser viewport.  The new UI is brought
together with Errai <em>(see earlier post)</em>.  Rule storage
now has a GIT backend so rule authors can take advantage
of the GIT workflow for publishing rules.  Finally, work
has been performed to create a high availability scenario
for the rules engine and everything is built together
with maven.  Drools 6 introduces a new principal object
extension point, KIE, for &ldquo;Knowledge is Everything&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Mark closed out the presentation with a brief note on
applying rules to situations you may not have thought of
as a convenient answer.  Watch Mark write Pong, implemented
in Drools.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I managed to check into my hotel and change shirts and still make the
next session.  I had planned on attending a totally different
session but the JUDCon session on Errai was too tempting to miss.</p>

<h2>Errai</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.jboss.org/errai">JBoss Errai</a> is a full stack UI
development framework that builds on <a href="https://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/">Google GWT</a>
to offer a single programming model for both the frontend and
application tier of a web application.  One of the goals of
the framework is to be entirely declarative and thereby avoid
writing boilerplate wherever possible.  Errai uses JEE6 APIs
and makes special use of the CDI APIs for injecting models
and services and attempts to have unobtrusive marshalling.</p>

<p>The structure of a JBoss Errai application is familiar looking
and pretty well organized:</p>

<pre><code>project_root/
  src/main/
    java/
      .gwt.xml
      client/** (Java code to generate the client)
      shared/** (Java code common between client and server)
      server/** (Java code specific to the server side)
    webapp/
      **.html
      WEB-INF/web.xml
    resources/
      *_App.properties
</code></pre>

<p>An interesting feature is the notion of a single-model for
transferring of structured objects between the server and
browser client.  Errai uses an annotation to mark this kind
of object as <code>@Portable</code>.  Doing so, data flow can be
bi-directional between the server and the client, as data
changes on the server can be automatically replicated to the
client via the available WebSockets connection and likewise
for data changes made by the client when reflected back to
the server.  Errai also supports polling, long polling and
messaging.  Naturally, JAX-RS functionality is available
for writing more specific operational services.  RPC like
functionality is enabled since writing in the single Java
language domain means that business methods can be invoked
directly by Java code in the <code>src/main/java/client/</code> tree,
and Errai sorts it out at code-generation time.</p>

<p><em>(Aside: I just noticed that putting on my glasses is like
going from DVD to BluRay. So <em>that&rsquo;s</em> what it says on the
bottom of the slide!)</em></p>

<p>The power of the single-language-domain model is evident
(inspired by other single-language models, like Meteor JS)
as suddenly the client can use things like JPA in the
<em>browser</em>.  Now of course, this is not &ldquo;true&rdquo; JPA but
feels like JPA when you are writing the code in a language
like Java, but actually dealing with browser features like
the local-storage APIs.</p>

<p>Errai uses templates to define the markup to render UI parts
of an application or objects.  Using the <code>data-</code> prefix
for attributes, which are valid to the HTML5 specification,
Errai provides the metadata required for the 2-way data
binding.  Note that this binding can only be performed on
objects marked <code>@Portable</code> as non-<code>@Portable</code> objects are
local to the origin language and will not have a JavaScript
translation. Type inference is performed when data is
migrated back and forth, for example between input and
textarea with the String type, or with Integers and errors
are reported where types cannot be translated.</p>

<p>In keeping with the overall move to WebSockets where the
browser is a first class citizen, Errai exposes notifications
corresponding to events which occur in the data model
(where <code>@Portable</code> is applied).  Naturally both the client
and server must support WebSockets, such as with a modern
web browser and an application server such as Tomcat 7.0.28
or WildFly.  Beyond just data model events, Errai can
receive and respond to <em>DOM Events</em>.  This is a game
changing feature for Java web application development as the
server can be a first class participant in the handling of
specific DOM events and take part in managing the viewport
of the client.</p>

<p>Security features in the framework are in progress, but
for now the <a href="https://www.jboss.org/picketlink">JBoss PicketLink</a>
looks like a good option.</p>

<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>I have to say, I came in expecting to heckle but came out
very pleasantly surprised.  I&rsquo;ll be using Errai for the next
Java based UI that I put together.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Delivering Real Time Push at Scale</h1>

<p><em>(Keeping an eye on the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/">WWDC</a>
announcements)</em></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s good to see a Linux OS doing the presenting, though it
looks like Ubuntu, not RHEL?  Oh I see, hah! it&rsquo;s just a virtual
machine.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.c2b2.co.uk">Mark Addy</a> started the presentation by
covering why we need to look at websockets and data grid solutions
in general.  After all, if what we have today must already work,
why do anything different?  The good news is, we can improve quite
a bit.  Existing mechanisms for delivering (or simulating) real time
data updates between a server and browser with HTTP are inherently
limited.  HTTP is a request-reply protocol, which means it is
a half-duplex connection, like using a walkie-talkie pair for
each connection open between the client and server.  Worse, only
the client can initiate the connection.  In our use case here,
the client is the browser.  Comet Cursor techniques, like polling
or even long-polling doesn&rsquo;t cut it for high concurrency or
high frequency updates.  Streaming over HTTP 1.1 connections is
not (as) memory efficient.</p>

<h2>Enter WebSockets</h2>

<p>WebSockets are available in HTML5 compliant browsers, described
by <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455.txt">RFC 6455</a> and in
JEE7 described by <a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr356/index.html">JSR 356</a>.
WebSockets provide a protocol upgrade path from traditional
HTTP, support full duplex communication (bidirectional
and simultaneous), support path parameters (<em>can you say:
RESTful WebSockets?</em>) and use only 2 bytes overhead per frame.</p>

<h2>JBoss Data Grid</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.redhat.com/products/jbossenterprisemiddleware/data-grid/">JBoss Data Grid</a>
is essentially a caching framework which includes data replication
and (re) distribution functionality.  This means that the sum of the
data included in a JBoss Data Grid cache is equivalent to the number
of elements in the cache multiplied by the number of nodes and divided
by the number of copies of the data between nodes.  Redundancy is
automatic with even data distribution.</p>

<p>For applications, a great feature of Data Grid is that as a
developer, you need not remember which node received data to retrieve
it back again later.  The data grid will note the location of each
entry and automatically retrieve it from any other node as necessary
when requested by an application.  Another is the support for <em>Cache
Events</em>.  Listening to cache events allows and application to take
advice from the cache when elements are changed or written.  For
example, in a dashboard if the source data aggregate changes in
response to a recurring map-reduce job, data could be made available
to dashboard listeners by issuing a push or pull request after
receiving an event notification that the data had changed in the cache.</p>

<p>Currently, JBoss Data Grid can only be used in an embedded mode, as
a java library in an application.  Soon multiple modes will be supported,
such as a client-server mode.  If you are using the new 8.0.0
<a href="http://wildfly.org">WildFly</a> application server then you can use
library mode with JBoss Data Grid right away.</p>

<h2>Optimizing Events</h2>

<p>Since multiple copies of data can exist in a distributed cache,
multiple events occur whenever data is updated as copies are refreshed.
An application most likely does not want to receive the additional
events and almost surely does not want to propogate a data refresh to
a WebSocket client connection if the data has not actually changed from
the first event received.  To resolve this, JBoss application servers
including HornetQ can enable the <em>de-duplication</em> feature on a JMS
Topic, resulting in an automatic purging of the duplicate cache
events as they are published to the topic.</p>

<pre><code>WebSocket Clients ............   *
          /|\
           |   (WebSocket Protocol)
          \|/
Application Message Driven Beans (@ServerEndpoint)
          /|\
           |   (JMS via Subscription)
           |
HornetQ Topic Publisher
  /|\     /|\    /|\
   |       |      |   (Data Grid Cache Events)
   |       |      |
JBoss Data Grid Layer
   |    |    |    |
  |X| .......... |X|  (Data Grid Nodes)
</code></pre>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Leaving AT&amp;T</h1>

<p>About one month ago today, I realized that the time has come to move on.
While I am leaving some people I have grown to admire, respect, and
consider as my friends, new opportunities present themselves each day
and I must choose the path which aligns best with my career drivers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pursuit of new challenges</li>
<li>Collaboration and Community</li>
<li>Open Source Innovation</li>
<li>Results</li>
</ul>


<p>Today, I have returned from the <a href="http://www.redhat.com/summit">2013 RedHat Summit</a>
and begin my first day in my office at my new job, as a Middleware
Solutions Architect for <a href="http://www.shadow-soft.com">Shadow-Soft</a>.</p>

<p>(More posts to come about the RedHat Summit)</p>

<p>In my new role, I&rsquo;m finally on the revenue side of a business rather
than an (IT) cost center.  I&rsquo;ll be doing some pre-sales, sales
engineering, and lots of architecture, presentations, training, and
concept development.</p>

<p>Things are looking bright for 2013 and the future.</p>
