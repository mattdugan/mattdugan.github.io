  <div class="entry-content"><p>Pete Muir was the presenter again, tailing off from his prior session on
<em>Building HTML5 Applications</em>.  This session should have some code examples
and more insights.</p>

<p>Diving into the code for the quickstarts, Pete makes a plug for
<a href="http://www.angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> and is clearly a big fan.  The
<em>difference</em> with Angular JS is that it feels like using a tag library
language rather than applying text base templates for substitution.  The
negative point is that since AngularJS does not use <code>data-</code> attribute
prefixes, each <code>ng-</code> attribute gets the red underline because it isn&rsquo;t
following the HTML5 doctype.  Shame.</p>

<p>Still, being able to see the same or similar quick starts represented with
variations on the implementation choices is the next best thing to diving
into a framework and trying to make something useful yourself.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.jboss.org/jdf/quickstarts/get-started/">Quickstarts</a>
source code is always available on <a href="https://github.com/jboss-jdf/%0Ajboss-as-quickstart">GitHub</a> and the individual pages for the quick start guides
have comments enabled which the authors tend to respond to.  This
communication is key since there are nearly 100 quick starts right now to
absorb and make sense of.</p>

<p>Code examples are presented using <a href="https://devstudio.jboss.com/download/6.x.html">JBoss Developer Studio</a>, the enterprise version of the
JBoss IDE.  The examples are executing on <a href="http://www.redhat.com/products/jbossenterprisemiddleware/application-platform/">JBoss EAP 6</a>, the
enterprise version of Wildfly (JBoss Application Server &ndash; Community Edition).</p>

<p>The workflow of making code changes or developing a project that you want
to deploy to your configured server from within the developer studio is
simple: just drag and drop the application module onto the server
configuration and it will deploy in the console.</p>

<h2>JBoss Forge</h2>

<p>Now the fun starts.  <a href="http://forge.jboss.org/">JBoss Forge</a> is a command
line CLI which <em>interprets</em> commands to cause code to be generated in the
project.  As I said before, this rapid prototyping feature from other
dynamic language platforms is finally making its way into Java
development.  Using TAB completion, Pete is able to quickly generate
additional entity classes in the example project and wire them up with CDI.</p>

<p>What immediately comes to mind is using Forge with a template script that
accepts some parameters (or YAML) markup to substitute into the Forge
script.  This could be a powerful way to quickstart applications of a
particular character while leaving the important decisions up to the
developer, while still ensuring that the generated application code matches
up to local policies and code structure guidelines.</p>

<p>Finally, using the JBoss Developer Studio, Pete <em>publishes</em> his application
directly to his <a href="http://www.openshift.com">OpenShift</a> instance, showing how a
developer can create and deploy an application onto the &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; that is
more than just a simple static website, but a real JEE client server
application.  What a use case!</p>

<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>The JDF roadmap for 2013 should add quickstarts for JBoss Fuse, Switch
Yard, JBPM and Drools.  Exciting times are ahead.  I wonder if having all
this quickstart collateral will cause the JBoss development team to slow
down the rate of change in the platform?  Naaah. :&ndash;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was the last session I attended prior to the start of the Summit
keynotes.  Presented by the Scotts (Cranton and McCarty), the session
turned out to be the very-high-level companion to Hiram&rsquo;s &lsquo;Making Apache
Active MQ Scale&rsquo; session.  Unfortunately, this session wasn&rsquo;t nearly as
deep as it could have been.</p>

<p>Presented from a laptop <em>covered</em> in stickers (but at least it was running
RHEL!), the session focused on the high level feature capabilities of
<a href="https://www.jboss.org/products/fuse">JBoss FUSE</a> and A-MQ.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.jboss.org/jbossamq">JBoss A-MQ</a> is the enterprise certified
and supported release of Apache Active MQ, with multiple protocol and
language support.  FUSE embeds Active MQ into Karaf using <a href="http://fusesource.com/products/fuse-fabric/">FUSE Fabric</a>.</p>

<p>Some of the added features or benefits are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The ability to use one backing store per broker, but with separation to
avoid blocking at the I/O controller</li>
<li>An operations managed cluster instead of product level clustering using
the Red Hat Cluster Suite</li>
<li>N+1 or N+2 architecture for highly available message brokers instead of
2N or more (like active/passive) configurations.</li>
</ul>


<p>The good news is that since everything is open source, we can dig into the
<a href="http://github.com/jboss-fuse">code</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Eric Schabell gave an emphatic <em>rah rah</em> presentation to encourage everyone
in attendance (not as many as you might think) to become actively involved
in speaking roles about technology, developer process, or really anything
they are passionate about.  This sounds kind of ho-hum and obvious, but it
is true advice for taking a career to the next step by becoming known for
<em>who</em> you are as well as well as <em>what</em> you do.  This notion was an
important one in my decision to make a career change and come work for
<a href="http://www.shadow-soft.com">Shadow Soft</a>.</p>

<h2>Knowledge, Passion and Tools</h2>

<p>The three tenants to your growth process are knowledge about what you
do (or what you want to be known for doing), the passion to do it and do
it well, and the tools you need in order to be successful in communicating
it to the world (or your desired audience, but why aim low?)</p>

<p>To exercise your personal growth, Eric recommends a simple three step plan:</p>

<ol>
<li>Choose your story you want to tell, or the project you want to be known
through.</li>
<li>Practice uniformity (more on this later)</li>
<li>Integrate it with <em>the Cloud</em>, or, differently phrased, make your
work discoverable and consumable by others via an established (and
popular) mechanism.</li>
</ol>


<p>If you are a developer or want to show things in the technology space,
practice making the <em>evidence</em> of your work public, mobile ready and
available through a common asset that your audience will have at their
disposal.  Generally, this can be summarized as &ldquo;Put it on the web.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Choosing your story or project is the first step because, as those of us
who have or work with children often offer as advice, it isn&rsquo;t enough to
want to be &ldquo;rich&rdquo; or &ldquo;famous&rdquo; or &ldquo;popular&rdquo;.  You have to answer the question
of <em>what</em> it is that made you rich or famous or popular.  Remember, people
can be well known for their spectacular failures just as well as they
can be known for spectacular success.  However, no one is known for
simply not trying.</p>

<p>Uniformity, particularly in the software space, can be applied to mean
the mode in which your software or concepts are downloaded, consumed and
how they interact with the participant.  Eric offers up his own template
for doing so on GitHub, via the <a href="https://www.github.com/eschabell/jboss-rock-star-template">JBoss Rock Star Template</a>.</p>

<p>It is important that you create a template for your own projects as well,
but stick to providing short and simple instructions for consuming it.  If
space is not prohibitive, include <em>everything</em> someone needs to get going
all in the same place.  Consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>How will the participant retrieve my project?</li>
<li>How will they install it?</li>
<li>How will they run it?</li>
<li>How long do they want to spend on it?</li>
<li>Where can they look for help?</li>
<li>What is the perception I want them to have?</li>
</ul>


<p>Answering these questions might lead you to select a uniform installation
script, a public hosting provider like GitHub for your open source projects,
a cloud hosting provider like <a href="http://www.openshift.com">OpenShift</a>, a
initialization script and corresponding local/remote deployment script, and
a README file in the root of your project.</p>

<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>If this all seems so simple, we have only to ask &ldquo;Am I doing it yet?&rdquo;  If not,
why not, and is that a good reason.  I want to move forward.  Not everyone
does (which can be a good thing).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.jboss.org">JBoss</a> has been doing a lot of work (and a lot of
writing) about their quick starts to application development on the JBoss
stack.  This is a <em>good thing</em> as..</p>

<ol>
<li>All the code is open source</li>
<li>JBoss has a huge number of projects and it can be difficult to make
sense of them all without good examples.</li>
</ol>


<p>Pete Muir (who could walk into any high school undetected) is
a superb presenter and is an active participant in the JBoss quickstart
projects.</p>

<p>There are nearly 100 <a href="https://www.jboss.org/jdf/quickstarts/get-started/">JBoss Quickstarts</a>
to assist developers and architects alike with doing their own work or just
getting familiar with the suite of JBoss projects available for use.  Most, if
not all, are available from GitHub and can be initalized using a maven
command or two.  Some quickstart projects are implemented more than once, with
variation between the implementation technology.  This is another great
technique for learning just what difference does using
<a href="http://angularjs.org/">Angular JS</a> vs <a href="https://www.jboss.org/errai">JBoss Errai</a>
or <a href="https://www.jboss.org/richfaces">RichFaces JSF</a> make for an application
(for example).</p>

<h2>TicketMonster</h2>

<p>The focus of today&rsquo;s presentation (and others to follow) was the
<a href="https://www.jboss.org/jdf/examples/ticket-monster/tutorial/WhatIsTicketMonster/">Ticket Monster</a>
example application.  It made use of several technologies, including the
new JEE-6 specification for CDI to inject implementations of common application
functionality into the business classes, <a href="https://www.redhat.com/products/jbossenterprisemiddleware/data-grid/">JBoss DataGrid</a>
as an application object cache and a choice of view layers.  The application
is written in such a way as to have a different UI for both desktop and
mobile view clients while maintaining a consistent service API on the JBoss
application server.</p>

<p>As a shortcut for developing management UI capability for the various domain
objects in Ticket Monster, <a href="http://forge.jboss.org/">JBoss Forge</a> was used
to generate the administration pages as scaffolds on top of the entity objects
for the Admin function.  This is a feature that has been around in Ruby and
Python domains for quite some time, and it is very good to see the scaffold
development utility appear in the Java space.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.jboss.org/errai">JBoss Errai</a> is used to provide a live data
binding between the UI and the server side of the application, which, via
Errai, automatically upgrades the connection to a WebSockets interleaved
stream when supported by both the browser and server.  Using CDI and events,
the communication between the client and server is highly interactive.</p>

<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>It is a point of personal satisfaction to see so much work being done to
help developers learn and do creative work, especially so since all of
the materials produced for the tutorials (and the application server itself)
is open source and available to all.  Kudos to the JBoss team and RedHat for
not looking for a &ldquo;line&rdquo; between what is open and what is closed, but for
being all open, all the time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Josh West and Andrew Dinn gave a well informed talk on various code and
runtime inspection tools in the JBoss toolbox.  First up was
<a href="https://www.jboss.org/tattletale">JBoss Tattletale</a>, used to inspect and
capture metadata for applications.  Tattletale creates an inventory of
all the libraries in and application and allows you to easily find which
jar is containing a class you have reason to be concerned with.  Ask anyone
who has tried to use the various online &ldquo;jar finder&rdquo; kinds of services and
they will tell you that being able to see a specific, context relevant
listing is a secret sauce.  Personally, I&rsquo;m glad to find a tool that allows
me to finally throw away my quick and dirty scripts combining find, unzip and
grep to look for class locations.  Tattletale creates and easy to search and
read report in HTML and can be invoked within your continous integration
build tool of choice so that reports are always at the ready.</p>

<p><a href="https://windup.jboss.org/index.html">JBoss Windup</a>, a tool I am personally
excited about to assist with inventory of applications deployed to Oracle or
IBM application servers produces output from Tattletale as one of its
artifacts.</p>

<h2>Decompiling</h2>

<p>Next, we looked briefly at decompilation options for code that you either
didn&rsquo;t write or don&rsquo;t own or (Heaven forbid) don&rsquo;t have the source code for
any longer.  <a href="http://java.decompiler.free.fr/?q=jdgui">JD-GUI</a> seems to be
the best of the readily available options, but itself is not open source. Of
course, that leaves you to wonder the obvious question of when you might need
to decompile the decompiler.  There is an open source JAVA decompiler in the
works, called <a href="https://github.com/bradsdavis/candle-decompiler">Candle</a> by
Brad Davis, the author of Cake, the tool behind Windup.</p>

<h2>Bytecode Magic</h2>

<p>This section could just as easily have been called <em>Black Magic</em>.  Bytecode
injection is a technique that not many leverage because it is simultaneously
powerful and tough to get right if you don&rsquo;t know exactly what you are doing.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jboss.org/byteman">Byteman</a> gives you the capability to inject
code at <em>RUNTIME</em> within just about any bit of code you have running, whether
you wrote it or not.  In a fantastic bit of functionality, this capability is
delivered as a <em>rule</em> you can define along with the code you want to be
injected and executed at the point defined by the rule.  You get local access
to variables and methods (if you know the names) so you can do detail logging
or property modification.  As a bonus, Byteman works at a lower level than
reflection, so you needn&rsquo;t worry about the public vs private nature of
class members.  While the obvious use is to inject logging and debugging
statements to better observe a problem, Byteman can also be used to assert
tests or conditions which are difficult (if not impossible) to reproduce in
a development environment.  For example, if the production environment has
a poorly handled runtime exception from time to time which cannot be
reproduced in any other environment, Byteman could be used on a developer&rsquo;s
workstation to inject the runtime exception at the exact point it is being
thrown in the live environment and develop proper handling and application
recovery.</p>

<p>Continuing to wax enthusiastic about Byteman, it has the ability to run as
an Agent on the JVM when passed as a command line parameter on startup,
allowing it to listen on a remote interface for live inspection of the
execution environment.  Rules submitted this way can be typechecked, so you
can be fairly certain that they will not cause a runtime error when
encountered.  However, the important thing to note is that if you are using
a very specific type, such as a particular kind of exception, be sure to
use the fully qualified name so as to avoid unexpected results if the
application has defined a local type with the same name that is in scope
of the executing rule, or in case the type is not already imported by the
parent class.</p>

<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>With runtime modification and injection, Java developers can get a taste of
4GL without leaving their cozy strongly typed 3rd generation language.</p>
