  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s 8PM, do you know where your true geeks are?  Well, the room was packed
for the Cloud Bursting with OpenShift birds of a feather session so the Red
Hat Summit 2013 in Boston might not be a bad guess.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.runcloudrun.com/">Grant Shipley</a> leads the session by
<em>skipping</em> the &ldquo;Intro to OpenShift&rdquo; because 18 out of 20 people in the room
are already diving in.  Awesome.  Grant runs his <em>blog</em> on
<a href="http://www.openshift.com">OpenShift</a> making it one of the few that can
elastically scale in response to load.</p>

<h2>OpenShift</h2>

<p>OpenShift is an ideal platform for deploying and hosting web applications
because of its architecture.
Supporting high deployment density is second nature and the ability to
scale out (or in) <em>automatically</em> is just gravy.  When Grant&rsquo;s blog isn&rsquo;t
taking any traffic, his OpenShift platform consumption is effectively
zero.  But, under load, he could have hundreds of instances of the blog app
pumped up on the OpenShift hosting servers, without having to touch
anything or even worry about it.</p>

<p>The public OpenShift actually runs on
Amazon EWS, which was an intentional decision on the part of Red Hat at
design and development time.  They wanted to create a platform which was
inherently cloud scalable and deployable on local, hosted, and third party
architecture.  Since OpenShift first went into public beta 2 years ago (at
Red Hat Summit <em>2011</em>) there have been over a million applications created
on the platform.  Now, Openshift is available for paid, enterprise services
as well as self-hosted deployment.</p>

<h2>Pricing</h2>

<p>Hosting production applications on OpenShift is as easy as developing on
OpenShift, but there is some cost involved.  However, the pricing model
starts off very low because the architecture is capable of high vertical
density.  To run an application using 3 <em>Gears</em> 24x7 (or 2,280 hours a
month) is free.  What&rsquo;s a Gear?  A SQL database is a Gear, an application
is a Gear, and any intermediary kind of platform is also a Gear.
Considering common 3-tier architecture, you could say &ldquo;your first app is
free, but the next one might cost you&rdquo;.  What a great excuse to get started.</p>

<h2>Uses</h2>

<p>As was publicly announced at the Red Hat Summit, Accenture is standardizing
web deployment on OpenShift.  However, Accenture isn&rsquo;t the first.  Already
Web PaaS providers are popping up, such as GetUp Cloud in Brazil.  I&rsquo;m sure
I&rsquo;ll be entering the fray quite soon myself with
<a href="http://www.shadow-soft.com">Shadow-Soft</a>.</p>

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<p>Not all containers are created equal.  OpenShift does advertise a container
architecture, but it is important to note that &ldquo;container&rdquo;, in this case,
is not a proper noun.  It does not refer to &ldquo;Linux Containers&rdquo;.  Instead,
it is a classical (and clever) configuration of CPU Groups, SE Linux
policies, and permissions which come together to provide <em>containment</em> to
individual user and application tenants on the OpenShift hosting platform.
When you install OpenShift yourself, you can use these techniques to say
&ldquo;user &lsquo;x&rsquo; has a minimum of 30% memory and CPU before scaling starts&rdquo; and
other such logical scaling boundaries.</p>

<h2>Community</h2>

<p>OpenShift is <em>very</em> active right now, primarily on IRC via the
<code>#OPENSHIFT_DEV</code> channel on FreeNode.  Generally, members of the
development team are always online somewhere in the world and a
conversation is flowing between users and developers.  Try getting that
with commercial proprietary software. :&ndash;)</p>

<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>OpenShift is the most exciting thing Red Hat has going right now, in my
opinion.  I am eager to work with it on premise.  The advantages it
gives in deployment scalability for web applications (or, can you say, Web
<em>APIs</em>?) is a blast from the past of hand tuned high performance web
hosting services with all the benefits of modern application and user
separatation and on-demand (on HTTP request) elastic scaling.</p>

<p>Also, the <em>My app runs on OpenShift</em> track jacket I picked up for deploying
on OpenShift live while at the Summit is sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Pete Muir was the presenter again, tailing off from his prior session on
<em>Building HTML5 Applications</em>.  This session should have some code examples
and more insights.</p>

<p>Diving into the code for the quickstarts, Pete makes a plug for
<a href="http://www.angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> and is clearly a big fan.  The
<em>difference</em> with Angular JS is that it feels like using a tag library
language rather than applying text base templates for substitution.  The
negative point is that since AngularJS does not use <code>data-</code> attribute
prefixes, each <code>ng-</code> attribute gets the red underline because it isn&rsquo;t
following the HTML5 doctype.  Shame.</p>

<p>Still, being able to see the same or similar quick starts represented with
variations on the implementation choices is the next best thing to diving
into a framework and trying to make something useful yourself.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.jboss.org/jdf/quickstarts/get-started/">Quickstarts</a>
source code is always available on <a href="https://github.com/jboss-jdf/%0Ajboss-as-quickstart">GitHub</a> and the individual pages for the quick start guides
have comments enabled which the authors tend to respond to.  This
communication is key since there are nearly 100 quick starts right now to
absorb and make sense of.</p>

<p>Code examples are presented using <a href="https://devstudio.jboss.com/download/6.x.html">JBoss Developer Studio</a>, the enterprise version of the
JBoss IDE.  The examples are executing on <a href="http://www.redhat.com/products/jbossenterprisemiddleware/application-platform/">JBoss EAP 6</a>, the
enterprise version of Wildfly (JBoss Application Server &ndash; Community Edition).</p>

<p>The workflow of making code changes or developing a project that you want
to deploy to your configured server from within the developer studio is
simple: just drag and drop the application module onto the server
configuration and it will deploy in the console.</p>

<h2>JBoss Forge</h2>

<p>Now the fun starts.  <a href="http://forge.jboss.org/">JBoss Forge</a> is a command
line CLI which <em>interprets</em> commands to cause code to be generated in the
project.  As I said before, this rapid prototyping feature from other
dynamic language platforms is finally making its way into Java
development.  Using TAB completion, Pete is able to quickly generate
additional entity classes in the example project and wire them up with CDI.</p>

<p>What immediately comes to mind is using Forge with a template script that
accepts some parameters (or YAML) markup to substitute into the Forge
script.  This could be a powerful way to quickstart applications of a
particular character while leaving the important decisions up to the
developer, while still ensuring that the generated application code matches
up to local policies and code structure guidelines.</p>

<p>Finally, using the JBoss Developer Studio, Pete <em>publishes</em> his application
directly to his <a href="http://www.openshift.com">OpenShift</a> instance, showing how a
developer can create and deploy an application onto the &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; that is
more than just a simple static website, but a real JEE client server
application.  What a use case!</p>

<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>The JDF roadmap for 2013 should add quickstarts for JBoss Fuse, Switch
Yard, JBPM and Drools.  Exciting times are ahead.  I wonder if having all
this quickstart collateral will cause the JBoss development team to slow
down the rate of change in the platform?  Naaah. :&ndash;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was the last session I attended prior to the start of the Summit
keynotes.  Presented by the Scotts (Cranton and McCarty), the session
turned out to be the very-high-level companion to Hiram&rsquo;s &lsquo;Making Apache
Active MQ Scale&rsquo; session.  Unfortunately, this session wasn&rsquo;t nearly as
deep as it could have been.</p>

<p>Presented from a laptop <em>covered</em> in stickers (but at least it was running
RHEL!), the session focused on the high level feature capabilities of
<a href="https://www.jboss.org/products/fuse">JBoss FUSE</a> and A-MQ.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.jboss.org/jbossamq">JBoss A-MQ</a> is the enterprise certified
and supported release of Apache Active MQ, with multiple protocol and
language support.  FUSE embeds Active MQ into Karaf using <a href="http://fusesource.com/products/fuse-fabric/">FUSE Fabric</a>.</p>

<p>Some of the added features or benefits are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The ability to use one backing store per broker, but with separation to
avoid blocking at the I/O controller</li>
<li>An operations managed cluster instead of product level clustering using
the Red Hat Cluster Suite</li>
<li>N+1 or N+2 architecture for highly available message brokers instead of
2N or more (like active/passive) configurations.</li>
</ul>


<p>The good news is that since everything is open source, we can dig into the
<a href="http://github.com/jboss-fuse">code</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Eric Schabell gave an emphatic <em>rah rah</em> presentation to encourage everyone
in attendance (not as many as you might think) to become actively involved
in speaking roles about technology, developer process, or really anything
they are passionate about.  This sounds kind of ho-hum and obvious, but it
is true advice for taking a career to the next step by becoming known for
<em>who</em> you are as well as well as <em>what</em> you do.  This notion was an
important one in my decision to make a career change and come work for
<a href="http://www.shadow-soft.com">Shadow Soft</a>.</p>

<h2>Knowledge, Passion and Tools</h2>

<p>The three tenants to your growth process are knowledge about what you
do (or what you want to be known for doing), the passion to do it and do
it well, and the tools you need in order to be successful in communicating
it to the world (or your desired audience, but why aim low?)</p>

<p>To exercise your personal growth, Eric recommends a simple three step plan:</p>

<ol>
<li>Choose your story you want to tell, or the project you want to be known
through.</li>
<li>Practice uniformity (more on this later)</li>
<li>Integrate it with <em>the Cloud</em>, or, differently phrased, make your
work discoverable and consumable by others via an established (and
popular) mechanism.</li>
</ol>


<p>If you are a developer or want to show things in the technology space,
practice making the <em>evidence</em> of your work public, mobile ready and
available through a common asset that your audience will have at their
disposal.  Generally, this can be summarized as &ldquo;Put it on the web.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Choosing your story or project is the first step because, as those of us
who have or work with children often offer as advice, it isn&rsquo;t enough to
want to be &ldquo;rich&rdquo; or &ldquo;famous&rdquo; or &ldquo;popular&rdquo;.  You have to answer the question
of <em>what</em> it is that made you rich or famous or popular.  Remember, people
can be well known for their spectacular failures just as well as they
can be known for spectacular success.  However, no one is known for
simply not trying.</p>

<p>Uniformity, particularly in the software space, can be applied to mean
the mode in which your software or concepts are downloaded, consumed and
how they interact with the participant.  Eric offers up his own template
for doing so on GitHub, via the <a href="https://www.github.com/eschabell/jboss-rock-star-template">JBoss Rock Star Template</a>.</p>

<p>It is important that you create a template for your own projects as well,
but stick to providing short and simple instructions for consuming it.  If
space is not prohibitive, include <em>everything</em> someone needs to get going
all in the same place.  Consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>How will the participant retrieve my project?</li>
<li>How will they install it?</li>
<li>How will they run it?</li>
<li>How long do they want to spend on it?</li>
<li>Where can they look for help?</li>
<li>What is the perception I want them to have?</li>
</ul>


<p>Answering these questions might lead you to select a uniform installation
script, a public hosting provider like GitHub for your open source projects,
a cloud hosting provider like <a href="http://www.openshift.com">OpenShift</a>, a
initialization script and corresponding local/remote deployment script, and
a README file in the root of your project.</p>

<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>If this all seems so simple, we have only to ask &ldquo;Am I doing it yet?&rdquo;  If not,
why not, and is that a good reason.  I want to move forward.  Not everyone
does (which can be a good thing).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.jboss.org">JBoss</a> has been doing a lot of work (and a lot of
writing) about their quick starts to application development on the JBoss
stack.  This is a <em>good thing</em> as..</p>

<ol>
<li>All the code is open source</li>
<li>JBoss has a huge number of projects and it can be difficult to make
sense of them all without good examples.</li>
</ol>


<p>Pete Muir (who could walk into any high school undetected) is
a superb presenter and is an active participant in the JBoss quickstart
projects.</p>

<p>There are nearly 100 <a href="https://www.jboss.org/jdf/quickstarts/get-started/">JBoss Quickstarts</a>
to assist developers and architects alike with doing their own work or just
getting familiar with the suite of JBoss projects available for use.  Most, if
not all, are available from GitHub and can be initalized using a maven
command or two.  Some quickstart projects are implemented more than once, with
variation between the implementation technology.  This is another great
technique for learning just what difference does using
<a href="http://angularjs.org/">Angular JS</a> vs <a href="https://www.jboss.org/errai">JBoss Errai</a>
or <a href="https://www.jboss.org/richfaces">RichFaces JSF</a> make for an application
(for example).</p>

<h2>TicketMonster</h2>

<p>The focus of today&rsquo;s presentation (and others to follow) was the
<a href="https://www.jboss.org/jdf/examples/ticket-monster/tutorial/WhatIsTicketMonster/">Ticket Monster</a>
example application.  It made use of several technologies, including the
new JEE-6 specification for CDI to inject implementations of common application
functionality into the business classes, <a href="https://www.redhat.com/products/jbossenterprisemiddleware/data-grid/">JBoss DataGrid</a>
as an application object cache and a choice of view layers.  The application
is written in such a way as to have a different UI for both desktop and
mobile view clients while maintaining a consistent service API on the JBoss
application server.</p>

<p>As a shortcut for developing management UI capability for the various domain
objects in Ticket Monster, <a href="http://forge.jboss.org/">JBoss Forge</a> was used
to generate the administration pages as scaffolds on top of the entity objects
for the Admin function.  This is a feature that has been around in Ruby and
Python domains for quite some time, and it is very good to see the scaffold
development utility appear in the Java space.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.jboss.org/errai">JBoss Errai</a> is used to provide a live data
binding between the UI and the server side of the application, which, via
Errai, automatically upgrades the connection to a WebSockets interleaved
stream when supported by both the browser and server.  Using CDI and events,
the communication between the client and server is highly interactive.</p>

<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>It is a point of personal satisfaction to see so much work being done to
help developers learn and do creative work, especially so since all of
the materials produced for the tutorials (and the application server itself)
is open source and available to all.  Kudos to the JBoss team and RedHat for
not looking for a &ldquo;line&rdquo; between what is open and what is closed, but for
being all open, all the time.</p>
